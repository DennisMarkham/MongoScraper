# MongoScraper

Ideally, this app was to scrape news articles and their URLs from yahoo.com if the user entered "/scrape" after the root url.  Clicking on the article title would bring up a comment submission form, as well as displaying previous comments, and a button for deleting them, on the right side.  However, it does not work.
